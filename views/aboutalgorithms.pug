      div.tab-content-header What is Beta?
      div.tab-content-body Beta is a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security 
        | or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is used in the capital 
        | asset pricing model (CAPM), which calculates the expected return of an asset based on 
        | its beta and expected market returns. Beta is also known as the beta coefficient. By 
        | definition, the market has a beta of 1.0, and individual stocks are ranked according to 
        | how much they deviate from the market. A stock that swings more than the market over 
        | time has a beta above 1.0. If a stock moves less than the market, the stock's beta is 
        | less than 1.0. High-beta stocks are supposed to be riskier but provide a potential for 
        | higher returns; low-beta stocks pose less risk but also lower returns.
      div.tab-content-header How is Beta calculated?
      div.tab-content-body Beta is calculated using regression analysis. Beta represents the 
        | tendency of a security's returns to respond to swings in the market. A security's beta 
        | is calculated by dividing the covariance the security's returns and the benchmark's 
        | returns by the variance of the benchmark's returns over a specified period.
      div.tab-content-header Is Beta safe to use?
      div.tab-content-body A stock's price variability is important to consider when assessing 
        | risk. If you think about risk as the possibility of a stock losing its value, beta has 
        | appeal as a proxy for risk. Intuitively, it makes plenty of sense. Think of an early-stage 
        | technology stock with a price that bounces up and down more than the market. It's hard 
        | not to think that stock will be riskier than, say, a safe-haven utility industry stock 
        | with a low beta. There are variations on beta depending on things such as the market 
        | index used and the time period measured â€“ but broadly speaking, the notion of beta is 
        | fairly straightforward. It's a convenient measure that can be used to calculate the costs 
        | of equity used in a valuation method that discounts cash flows.

    div(class="tab-wrapper" id="RSI")
      div.tab-content-header What is RSI?
      div.tab-content-body RSI stands for "Relative Strength Index". It is a momentum indicator 
        | developed by noted technical analyst Welles Wilder, that compares the magnitude of recent 
        | gains and losses over a specified time period to measure speed and change of price movements 
        | of a security. It is primarily used to attempt to identify overbought or oversold conditions 
        | in the trading of an asset.
      div.tab-content-header How is RSI calculated?
      div.tab-content-body The relative strength index is calculated using the following formula: 
      div.tab-content-body
      div.tab-content-body RSI = 100 - 100 / (1 + RS) 
      div.tab-content-body
      div.tab-content-body Where RS = [Average of Upward Price Change] / [Average of Downward Price Change]
      div.tab-content-header How is RSI used?
      div.tab-content-body Traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI is that RSI values of 
        | 70 or above indicate that a security is becoming overbought or overvalued, and therefore 
        | may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price. On the other side of 
        | RSI values, an RSI reading of 30 or below is commonly interpreted as indicating an oversold 
        | or undervalued condition that may signal a trend change or corrective price reversal to 
        | the upside.

      div.tab-content-header What are Moving Averages?
      div.tab-content-body A moving average (MA) is a commonly used technical indicator that is intended 
        | to smooth out price action by filtering out "noise" caused by random price fluctuations. It is 
        | considered a trend-following indicator because it is based on past prices. Moving Averages are 
        | the basis for many different strategies, but for this program, we'll just be utilizing a Simple 
        | Moving Average.
      div.tab-content-header How does a Simple Moving Average work?
      div.tab-content-body A Simple Moving Average is a customizable arithmetic moving average that is  
        | calculated by adding the closing price of the security for a number of time periods, and then 
        | dividing that sum by the total number of time periods. This gives the average price of the 
        | security over the time period...
